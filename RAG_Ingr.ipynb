Vitamin C functions best in the daytime, protecting against the assaults of the day like UV rays and pollution. On the other hand, retinol should be applied at night because it makes skin more photosensitive, increasing the risk of sun damage. When used together, they may increase the risk of overdrying, irritation, and decreasing the ability to absorb vitamin C due to their high pH levels. It's suggested to use salicylic acid in the morning and retinoid at night to minimize adverse effects.\""
